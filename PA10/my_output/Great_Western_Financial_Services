I could not have ASKED for a better LO and processor in Doug Turner and Jaclyn Niehaus with Great Western. I was litterally in tears at being given the 'run around' by several other financial instututions, when my phone rang with Doug calling to put all my worries at ease. They made the entire process of buying my first 'big home' a walk in the park!! Doug and Jaclyn are TRUELY 'miracle workers' to ME, making EVERYTHING happen just as smoothly as possible and oh SO FAST!! They were SO very communicative and helpful with my EVERY bugging question at all hours of the day and night, holiday or not. You can not go wrong using Great Western. As I said I got SO many headaches from Quicken Loans and Lending Tree and almost down right scammed, until I was completely "saved" by Doug and his team at Great Western!!! THANKS YOU GUYS made for the best holidays!!

I was referred to Lori Smolke at Great Western through LendingTree.  I got a really great deal, and perhaps better than that my experience working with Lori went incredibly smoothly.  Of course I needed to come up with an arm and a leg, pdf it, sign it, fax it, etc.  But that is required of all institutions.  I refinanced another property a short while ago and was handed off from one person to another and when it came time to sign I was given a 1-day timeframe, rush speed, no planning time whatsoever.  It was hectic and uncalled for.  My experience with Lori and Great Western, as I said, was smooth as could be.  Lori always responded promptly and was always able to help with whatever I needed.  I definitely recommend working with Lori!

I had contacted Great Western for a cash out refinance on my home in order to pay for some contract/construction work that needed to be done on my home. When the process started out my assigned loan officer was very friendly and called me regularly. I was promised a closing date of 30 after the start of the application process. The process moved fairly quickly in the beginning (The first week) I submitted all of my documents , esigned all of the paperwork  needed to start processing on the loan within seven days of starting the process. I selected the amount the lender recommended for the loan, and told the to start working it up. Then the communication stopped, no calls, very sparse communication from the lender. Which really put me off. At one point I was promised a closing date less than 2 weeks after the process started. Which never occurred, there where several delays. The Loan was not completely settled and closed until 36 days after the process began. During this time I found myself having to consistently call the lender to find out what the status was at one point they would not return phone calls, and instead opt to send emails.  ...  ... Besides the delays in processing, they ... 1.) changed the title to my home and did not inform me until after the I signed the closing paperwork from the title company. Which delayed closing by a couple days. ... 2.) Setup a mobile notary, and did not coordinate anything with me. They just gave me a date and time. When the notary showed up, she told me my wife needed to be present for signing as well. This too was not communicated so the notary and I had to drive to my wife's school and pull her out of class for 45 minutes to sign documents.  ... 3.) They changed my good faith estimate , and never told me I only found out during my final signing. I know estimates change based on credit worthiness. However a courtesy call would have been nice.  ... 4.) My lender told me not make my march mortgage payment. Which was a lie and I ended up getting charged over $120 in late fees on my mortgage payment due to this. I then ended up having to pay the title company back for these late fees since they had to cover these. Also had to deal with demand letters and calls from my bank demanding payment.  ... 5.) Somewhere along the lines my payoff amount for my mortgage was miscalculated which ended up leaving a $1000 difference between what was actually owed versus what was paid. Luckily the title company covered this for me and did not charge me.  ... 6.) They paid off one of my credit cards but shorted the payment by several hundred dollars. ... 7.) instead of electronically transferring the payoff for the credit card directly to the credit card company. They issued me a separate check to mail to the credit card company for them.  ...  ... I know everything cant be perfect these are various grievances I had. A lot of these issues simply could have been taken care of with a little more communication between the lender and myself.

I put my info in a couple of mortgage websites, (lendingtree.com and another one) and got a long introductory email from M.S. from this office. (I'm withholding the actual name) ...  ... I just replied to M.S. very clearly. I'm just want a simple quote for a 15 yeard fixed rate refi for a rental. I said DO NOT CALL. ...  ... M.S. sent me back his rate, a one liner: "3.375% 15 yr approx. $1800 in cost" ...  ... So far perfect! That's all I wanted to know. Rate is not better than what I already have so I move on. ...  ... Then I got mutliple calls from their office. I wasn't picking any calls from unknown numbers, because I was receiving dozen of calls a day from would be lender. ...  ... Then I got another email from M.S., saying he is trying to contact me again, so I replied to him, somewhat forcefully: ...  ... ""Subject: Re: Your mortgage inquiry ...  ... Your rate is not competitive. ... And what part of "DO NOT CALL" in my original email was hard to understand? ... Do not contact me again. ...  ... Thanks. ... "" ...  ... All I got for that was a nasty answer: ...  ... "" Our rates are very competitive, thats why were lending trees number one lender. Besides how would you even know when I haven't talked to you. I dont know where you are getting your information from but it's incorrect pal. You probably don't even qualify for a refinance anyways.  ... "" ...  ...  ... Wow. I think that deserved a bad yelp review. ...  ... I suspect that M.S. got confused, and that he got my info twice from 2 different sites, but that's not an excuse for this angry reply. ...  ... Granted, my emails can be seen as rude, but if you are doing business through lending tree or similar websites, you should expect that your potential customer may be a bit fed-up with being overwhelmed with calls and emails.
